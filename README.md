# analyze-eye-tracking-data

A Python pipeline for analyzing pupillary light reflex (PLR) data from eye-tracking tests.

## Project Overview

This project provides tools and scripts for analyzing pupillary light reflex data collected from eye-tracking experiments. The analysis pipeline is designed to process raw data, extract meaningful insights, and generate visualizations.

### Science Background

The pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a physiological response where the pupil constricts or dilates in response to changes in light intensity. This reflex is controlled by the autonomic nervous system and provides valuable insights into neurological and ocular health. By analyzing PLR data, researchers can study various conditions, including brain injuries, neurological disorders, and visual impairments.

## Documentation

The following documents are available in the `docs` folder:

- **[Engineering Home Assignment](docs/Engineering%20Home%20Assignment/Home%20Assignment.pdf):** Contains the detailed description of the assignment.
- **[Landmark Definitions](docs/Engineering%20Home%20Assignment/Landmark%20Definitions.pdf):** Provides definitions and explanations of key landmarks used in the analysis.

## Data

The `plr_data` folder contains raw data files organized by unique identifiers. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific dataset.
